# **App Name**: Link Summarizer

## Core Features:

- Website Summarization: Uses a large language model to generate a summary of the content at the URL. The LLM is a tool that decides what information to include, if any.
- Link List: Stores links and summaries in a list in the browser's local storage.
- Markdown Export: Exports the list of links and summaries as a Markdown file.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark background color (#121212) for a modern, minimal look.
- Light text color (#FFFFFF) for readability against the dark background.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean and simple layout with plenty of whitespace.
- Use minimalist icons for actions like 'Summarize' and 'Export'.
