Dia is a 1.6B parameter text-to-speech model by Nari Labs that generates realistic dialogue from a transcript, with control over emotion and tone via audio conditioning. It supports nonverbal cues and is currently English-only. The project provides access to pretrained model checkpoints and inference code on Hugging Face, along with a demo page for comparison. Features include dialogue generation with speaker tags, non-verbal cues, and voice cloning. The model has been tested on GPUs and requires pytorch 2.0+ and CUDA 12.6. The project is licensed under Apache 2.0, with restrictions against identity misuse, deceptive content, and illegal/malicious use.
